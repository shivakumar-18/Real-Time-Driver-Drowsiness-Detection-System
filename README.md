# Real-Time-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

One safety feature that helps stop accidents caused by drivers who nod off while driving is drowsiness detection. The goal of this project is to develop a drowsiness detection system that uses computer vision to automatically identify drowsiness in real-time from a live video stream and then notify the user through an alarm.
